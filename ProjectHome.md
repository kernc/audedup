<font size='4'><b>audedup</b></font> attempts to find duplicates (even different recordings, good covers, ...) in your audio collections.

It requires:
  * **Python2.7+**
  * **NumPy** (`python-numpy` package; for FFT, convolution, and other calculations), and
  * **FFmpeg** or **MPlayer** (executable in $PATH; for converting various audio formats (e.g. mp3, mp4, ogg, flac, ...) into usable [PCM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation)).

Tested on GNU/Linux, but AFAIK, it should work on any inferior platforms too.

As of now, it's a single file, and you can [download it here](http://code.google.com/p/audedup/source/browse/audedup.py) (try "View [raw file](http://audedup.googlecode.com/git/audedup.py)" in the right sidebar).

Would you like to know **HowItWorks**?

Perhaps you're interested in accepted **CommandLineArguments**.

Or maybe you want to see a successful **ExampleRun**.
